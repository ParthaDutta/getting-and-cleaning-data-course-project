#How to tidy data

##Initial setup

The source data was obtained from this link https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

After downloading zip please extract to a temporary folder of your choice
After extraction copy the folder that holds the data to the working directory where the run_analysis.r script exists
To make sure the correct folder is chosen, it will contain two sub-folders called "test" and "train" 
After it is copied across please rename folder to "extracted-data"
This is a requirement of being able to execute the script "run_analysis.R" 


So for example, unzipping to root will create the following folder structure

c:\UCI HAR Dataset
c:\UCI HAR Dataset\UCI HAR Dataset
c:\UCI HAR Dataset\UCI HAR Dataset\test
c:\UCI HAR Dataset\UCI HAR Dataset\train

Copy the sub folder ..\UCI HAR Dataset (not c:\UCI HAR Dataset) and rename

##Execute
